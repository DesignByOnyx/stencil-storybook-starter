# Stencil Storybook Starter

> If you just want to try this out,  do the following :
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/DesignByOnyx/stencil-storybook-starter.git
> cd stencil-storybook-starter
> git remote remove origin
> npm install
> npm run storybook
> ```

This is a starter app for developing stencil components with Storybook. This app was generated by using `npm init stencil` and selecting  the "component" starter. After that, the following actions were performed. You should be able to follow these steps to integrate storybook into your existing stencil project:

1. The following folders/files were written for this project and should be copied/merged into your project:
    - `.storybook/`
    - `babel.config.js`
    - `src/custom.d.ts`

1. Update the "compilerOptions" in your `tsconfig` to include the following:

    ```
    "skipLibCheck": true
    ```

1. Install all of the dependencies

    ```
    npm install storybook webpack glob case babel-loader typescript awesome-typescript-loader babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node npm-run-all @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-typescript @storybook/html @storybook/addon-info @storybook/addon-knobs @storybook/addon-notes @storybook/addon-viewport @types/jest @types/storybook__html @types/storybook__addon-knobs -D
    ```
    > **NOTE:** it looks like a lot... it is. All of the above are necessary except `npm-run-all` (see next step).
    >
    > **NOTE:** you will get a lot of warnings about missing react dependencies and outdated packages. You will have to ignore these or go bug the project maintainers about managing dependencies a little better.

1. Add the following to the "scripts" section of your `package.json`. If you chose not to install `npm-run-all`, you will need to update your scripts so that stencil will run `watch` in "prod" mode while the storybook server is running.

    ```
    "watch": "stencil build --docs --watch",
    "storybook.run": "start-storybook --port 9001",
    "storybook": "npm-run-all --parallel watch storybook.run"
    ```

1. Finally, start the storybook server and check out all your component stories!
    ```
    npm run storybook
    ```

## How it works

Well, it's complicated. All you really need to know is that the code in the project should generate a story for every component in your project along with knobs for all of your exposed `@Props`. If your project structure is different than the one here, you will need to update the code at the top of `.storybook/stories/stencil.js` to point to the correct locations. For more advanced stenarios, check out the `.story.js` file inside `src/components/simple-config`.

# Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-component-starter.git my-component
cd my-component
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, we recommend _not_ using `stencil` in the component name (ex: `<stencil-datepicker>`). This is because the generated component has little to nothing to do with Stencil; it's just a web component!

Instead, use a prefix that fits your company or any name for a group of related components. For example, all of the Ionic generated web components use the prefix `ion`.


## Using this component

### Script tag

- [Publish to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)
- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='https://unpkg.com/my-component@0.0.1/dist/mycomponent.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### Node Modules
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='node_modules/my-component/dist/mycomponent.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### In a stencil-starter app
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Add an import to the npm packages `import my-component;`
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc
